# computational compositions
kia ora, this is a helper repo for using turtle and conceptual art to think in a modular way

we have three files: [main](main.py), [logics](logics.py), and [compositions](compositions.py)

don't think about this as particularly useful or impressive code. In fact, very soon you will see that it is terrible and you will be able to improve it easily. Just remember that, for now, we are using conceptual art as a guide. It aids our exploration into programming as we dive a bit deeper. We know about thinking in pseudocode already, and [Sol Lewitt's](https://whitney.org/education/families/kids-art-challenge/sol-lewitt) art can be useful for us because he focused on instructional and elements. We can use this to help us think about how to write code generally.

run the main file and it will randomly pick a composition.

start off by making your own compositions. You can use the logics file to help you. You can also use the turtle library to help you.

if you want to run just your own composition you can either comment out the other compositions in the main file, or you can just write your own main file and only use your composition.
